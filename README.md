Automatic generating turning signal in automotive vehicle using ESP32

This code cater to my "Modeling Turn Signal System of Vehicle" project. I introduce a new feature that the vehicle can automatically generate turn signal when start turning and no need for human action. And the code use http framework to model the situation that the driver turning steering wheel, then the code would generate corresponding signal to Output Ports.
